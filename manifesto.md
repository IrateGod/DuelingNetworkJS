For the HTML/CSS/JS project we require an user backlog to work off of. The way things have been done have been negatively geared. Suggestions and the ablity for things to be done usually caught up in a lengthy process and in general no strong goal besides keep chaos to a minimum given. With the increase in man power, tooling, and community backing given to DN, DN needs to make clear its goals and services to the YGO community.

This will facilitate the following. A positively; orientation, mindset, and aligned baseline for future suggestions. Unified understanding of the roles of various user and administrator classes within DN. Unified understanding of DN's soverignity within the sim collective. Self moderation of parties adding code to DN's code base.

I require the following from as many administors as possible.

1.) A paragraph or more explaining 'what DuelingNetwork is', please be wordy with your response. The explaination should be good enough for the opening post of a DGZ thread.
2.) From your position's perspective what is the user experience like for doing the following.
    registering
    signing in
    making a deck
    finding your first duel
    learning the controls
    using the controls in your first duel
    communicating with other users
    using the forum
    what to do when you have a problem in a duel

Try to take two or more sentences for each and be as clear as possible. Users are welcome to do this also as an exercise and get thoughts flowing. The completed thread, after a few pages will be compiled into a manifesto and posted as a sticky in an appropriate place. A response from from each of the highest ranked administration will complete the task.
